    "By the end of this lab, we expect that a well-prepared student will be able to: \n",
    "- Read data from a .bag file \n",
    "- Select and apply appropriate statistical analysis types to easting and northing data\n",
    "- Analyze data using appropriate statistical and plotting tools in Python\n",
